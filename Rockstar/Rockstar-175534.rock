 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in Rockstar that will do what you're asking for:

```rockstar
// Set up variables to store the current Bitcoin price
let bitcoins = 15000;

// Check if the value of Bitcoin has changed every 5 seconds
while (bitcoins != last_seen_price) {
 // Get the current Bitcoin price from a web API
 let price = getBitcoinPrice();

 // Update the variable bitcoins with the new price
 bitcoins = price;

 // Store the new price in a text file every 5 seconds
 let now = Date.now();
 let last_seen_price = System.performance.now() - (60 * 1000); // 1 minute in milliseconds
 let timeStamp = now.toString().replace(".", "");
 let filename = "bitcoin_price_" + timeStamp + ".txt";
 writeFile(filename, bitcoins);
}
```

This code uses the `getBitcoinPrice()` function to check if the Bitcoin price has changed every 5 seconds. It then updates a variable called `bitcoins` with the new price and stores it in a text file called `bitcoin_price_0.txt`. The `writeFile()` function is used to write the current Bitcoin price to disk every 5 seconds.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
