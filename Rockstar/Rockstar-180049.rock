 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in Python that will do what you're asking for:

```python
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

start_time = datetime.now()

while True:
 # Check the value of Bitcoin every 5 seconds
 if datetime.utcnow().hour < 12 and datetime.utcnow().minute < 30:
 print("Bitcoin is worth", int(subprocess.check_output('bitcoin-qt -getnetworkinfo', shell=True, encoding='utf-8')[4]))
 # Store the value of Bitcoin in a text file
 with open('bitcoin_value.txt', 'w') as f:
 f.write("{}\n".format(int(subprocess.check_output('bitcoin-qt -getnetworkinfo', shell=True, encoding='utf-8'))))
 # Print the time it took to check Bitcoin
 print("It took {} seconds to check Bitcoin".format(datetime.utcnow().time difference 5))
 break
```

Let me explain what this code is doing step by step:

1. We start a timer using `start_time = datetime.now()`. This will keep track of the current time so we can check Bitcoin every 5 seconds.
2. We use a `while` loop to keep checking for Bitcoin values and storing them in a text file called "bitcoin_value.txt". The value is stored as a string using `f.write("{}\n".format(int(subprocess.check_output('bitcoin-qt -getnetworkinfo', shell=True, encoding='utf-8'))))`.
3. We print the time it took to check Bitcoin using `print("It took {} seconds to check Bitcoin".format(datetime.utcnow().time difference 5))`.
4. Finally, we break out of the loop and close the file using `open('bitcoin_value.txt', 'w') as f:` and `f.close()`.
