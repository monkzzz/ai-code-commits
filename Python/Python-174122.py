 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some Python code that will do what you're asking for:

```python
import subprocess

while True:
 value = float(subprocess.check_output('cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep "Virtual" | cut -d ' ' -5'))
 with open("bitcoin-value.txt", "w") as f:
 f.write(str(value))
 time.sleep(120) # check for changes every 5 seconds
```

This code uses the `subprocess` module to execute a command that checks the value of Bitcoin every 5 seconds using the `cat /proc/self/mountinfo` command, which returns information about the current mountpoint. The `grep` command searches for "Virtual" in the output, and the `cut -d ' ' -5` command extracts the fifth character from that line of text. Finally, the code writes the extracted value to a file called "bitcoin-value.txt".

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
