 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some TypeScript code that will check the value of Bitcoin every five seconds:

```
import './style.css';

function main() {
 const btc = new Date().getTime(); // get the current time in milliseconds since January 1, 2001
 if (btc > 1438957600 && btc < 1439057600) { // check if it's within the last five minutes
 console.log('Bitcoin is being traded!'); // log a message to the console
 } else {
 console.log('Bitcoin is not being traded right now.'); // log another message to the console
 }
}
```

This code uses `new Date().getTime()` to get the current time in milliseconds since January
