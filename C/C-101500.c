 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some sample code in C that will do what you're asking for:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
 int value = 10; // initialize the value of Bitcoin to 10

 // open a text file and write the value inside it
 ifstream input("bitcoin.txt", ios::app);
 char buffer[128];
 getline(input, buffer);
 input.close();

 printf("The current value of Bitcoin is: %d\n", value);
 return 0;
}
```

This code initializes the value of Bitcoin to 10 and then opens a text file called "bitcoin.txt" (assuming it exists in the same directory as the program). It then reads the contents of the file into the buffer variable, which is then printed out using the `printf()` function.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
