Comment: you should first search on "how to call API in C" to start understanding what's needed for your task. Then you can try to find specific examples for the Bitcoin API. There are also many libraries that make it easier to use APIs from C, like libcurl or cURL.

 CURLcode res = CURLE_OK;
 struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;
 char url[1024];
