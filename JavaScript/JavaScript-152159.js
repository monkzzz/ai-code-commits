 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in JavaScript that will do what you're asking for:

```javascript
// Define the function to check Bitcoin
function checkBitcoin() {
 // Create a variable to store the current value of Bitcoin
 let bitcoin = 0;

 // Check if the current time is within the last 5 seconds
 setInterval(function() {
 // Get the current date and time
 const now = new Date().getTime();

 // Calculate the difference between the current time and the start time (5 seconds ago) in milliseconds
 let diffMs = Math.abs(now - startTime);

 // Check if the current time is within 5 seconds of the start time
 if (diffMs >= 1000 && diffMs <= 2000) {
 // If so, update the Bitcoin value in the text file
 bitcoin = Math.floor(Math.random() * 99);
 writeFile('bitcoin-value.txt', 'Bitcoin: ' + bitcoin);
 }
 }, 5000);
}, 18247); // Start checking every 5 seconds
```

This code defines a function called `checkBitcoin()`, which checks the value of Bitcoin every 5 seconds by calling a random number generator. The current value is stored in a variable called `bitcoin`. The function then writes this value to a text file called `bitcoin-value.txt` using the `writeFile()` method.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
