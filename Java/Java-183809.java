 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could use Java to create a program that displays the character "kayku" in Japanese:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Kayaku {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 System.out.print("Enter a character (k-a-y-u): ");
 char c = input.next().charAt();
 System.out.println(c + " is the japanese kayaku.");
 }
}
```

This program uses the Scanner class to prompt the user for input, and then reads in the character using the `next()` method. Finally, it prints out a message that explains what the character "kayku" means in Japanese.
