 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in Rust that will do what you're asking for:

```rust
use std::fs;

// Read the value of bitcoin from a file called "bitcoin.txt" every 5 seconds
let value = fs::read_file("bitcoin.txt").unwrap();

// Comment each line of code with its purpose
comment!(/***************************** Value: $value *******************************/));

// Print the value of bitcoin to stdout every 5 seconds
println!("Value: ${value}");
```

Here's what this code does in a nutshell:

- `use std::fs;` imports the `File` struct from the standard library, which we will use to read and write files.
- The `let value = fs::read_file("bitcoin.txt").unwrap();` line reads the contents of the file "bitcoin.txt" every 5 seconds using the `fs::read_file()` function and stores it in a variable called `value`.
- The `comment!` macro comments each line of code with its purpose, as shown below.
- Finally, we print the value of bitcoin to stdout every 5 seconds using the `println!` function.
