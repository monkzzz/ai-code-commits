 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in Rust that checks the value of Bitcoin every five seconds:

```rust
use std::time;

let (unix_time, _) = time::Duration::from_secs(5 * 60); // 5 minutes == 300 seconds

if unix_time < 1 {
 println!("Bitcoin is not available at this moment.");
} else if (unix_time + 2 ** 30) % 8 == 0 {
 println!("The value of Bitcoin has increased by $0.0005 since the last check.");
} else {
 println!("The value of Bitcoin is stable and remains constant at this moment.");
}
```

This code uses `time::Duration::from_secs()` to get the current time
