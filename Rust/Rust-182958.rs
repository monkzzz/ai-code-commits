 Sure, here's some sample code in Rust that prints "Hello World" to the console:

```rust
println!("Hello world");
```

This code uses the `println()` function from the `std::io` module to print the string "Hello world" to the console. You can replace the text inside the `println()` call with any other message you want to display.
