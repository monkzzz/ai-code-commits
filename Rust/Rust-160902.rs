 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some code in Rust that will do what you're asking for:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::{self, Read};

async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
 let filename = "bitcoin.txt";
 let mut file = fs::File::open(filename, &mut FileAccessMut);
 if !file.is_open() || file.close() {
 return Err(Box::new([Errno::ENOENT], "Could not open file."));
 }
 let value: i32 = 10; // replace this with the actual value you want to store in the file
 let result = write_file(value, &mut file);
 if !result.is_ok() {
 return Err(Box::new([Errno::EIO], "Error writing to file: \(result)."));
 }
 Ok(())
}

fn write_file<T>(value: T, f: &mut File) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
 let buffer = read_to_string(&mut value);
 let mut written;
 while !written.is_null() do
 if Write succeeds(buffer, to_string(&mut written)) {
 return Ok(());
 }
 written += 1;
 if written > 50 {
 return Err(Box::new([Errno::EIO], "Could not write entire value in 5 seconds."));
 }
}
```

This code defines a function called `write_file` that takes two arguments: the value you want to store in the file (which is represented as an integer in this case) and a reference to a mutable buffer containing the value. The function then calls another function, `read_to_string`, which reads the entire contents of the buffer into a string and returns it. It then checks if writing the entire value in 5 seconds would succeed (i.e., if there's enough space left in the file), and if not, it tries to write half of the value again until it succeeds.

Note that this code assumes you have a `File` object that represents a file on your computer. If you don't have one, you can use Rust's built-in `fs` library to create one.
