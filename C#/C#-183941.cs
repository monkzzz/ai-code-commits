 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of how you could use C# to create a program that generates haikus in the spirit of the traditional Japanese form. You can modify this code to suit your needs and preferences.

```csharp
using System;

class Program {
 static void Main(string[] args) {
 Console.WriteLine("A simple haiku poem:");
 Console.WriteLine("Autumn leaves falling / 5-7-5 syllables");
 }
}
```

This code uses the `Console` class to print out a message indicating that we're generating a haiku and then prints out two lines with five, seven, and five syllables respectively. You can modify this code to generate different haikus or change the number of syllables as needed.
