 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some sample code in C# that you can use as a starting point:

```c
#include <winsock2.h>

typedef struct _SOCKET {
 int family;
 short sock_port;
 char path[10];
} SOCKET, *PSOCKET;

void servername(char* name);
int connect(PSOCKET socket, const char* hostname, int portnum);
int send(PSOCKET socket, const void* ptr, size_t size);
int recv(PSOCKET socket, void** ptr, size_t *size);
void close(PSOCKET socket);

#include <ws2.h>

#ifdef __MINGW32__
#pragma GCC diagnostic push
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wall"
#endif

int main() {
 SOCKET sock;
 char filename[100];

 servername("bitcoin.org");

 if (connect(&sock, "localhost", 8080) == 0) {
 printf("Connected to Bitcoin server\n");
 send(sock, (void*) &value, sizeof(int)); // Send the value of bitcoin to the server
 recv(sock, &value, sizeof(int)); // Receive the value of bitcoin from the server
 close(sock);
 printf("Value of Bitcoin: %d\n", value);
 } else {
 printf("Failed to connect to Bitcoin server\n");
 }

 return 0;
}
```

This code uses the Winsock2 library to establish a connection with a Bitcoin server. It sends and receives data using the `recv()` and `send()` functions, and closes the socket using the `close()` function. You'll need to modify this code to read the value of bitcoin from a file instead of a server.

To do that, you can create a text file called `bitcoin.dat` in your project directory with the desired value of bitcoin stored inside it. Then, modify the `recv()` function to read data from the file instead of the server:

```c
char buffer[1024];
size_t bytes_read;

if (recv(sock, (void*) &buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0) == SOCKET_ERROR) {
 perror("recv");
 exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

This code reads data from the `bitcoin.dat` file and stores it in the `buffer` variable. You can then print out the value of bitcoin using the `printf()` function:

```c
if (strlen(buffer) > 0) {
 int value = atoi(buffer);
 printf("Value of Bitcoin: %d\n", value);
} else {
 printf("No data received\n");
}
```

This code checks if any data was received from the server. If there is no data, it prints out a message indicating that no data was received. You can modify this code to read data from your file instead of the server by changing the `recv()` function call accordingly.
