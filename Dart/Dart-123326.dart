 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some sample code in Dart that will do what you're asking for:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

// Define a constant to store the current Bitcoin value
const int BITCOIN_VALUE = 10000; // 10000 is the current value of Bitcoin

// Create a file called "bitcoin.txt" in the same directory as your program
File bitcoinFile = File("bitcoin.txt");

// Read the contents of the file every five seconds and store it in a variable
DateTime now = DateTime.now();
double currentValue = 0;
while (true) {
 if (!bitcoinFile.existsSync()) {
 break; // Stop reading if the file doesn't exist
 }
 String contents = bitcoinFile.readToStringSync();
 double value = parseDouble(contents);
 currentValue += value * BITCOIN_VALUE / 1000; // Calculate the new value based on the current exchange rate
 setBitcionValue(currentValue);
}
```

Let me explain what this code does step by step:

1. We start with a constant that stores the current Bitcoin value, which is currently $10000.
2. We create a file called "bitcoin.txt" in the same directory as our program. This file will store the current value of Bitcoin that we read from every five seconds.
3. We use `DateTime.now()` to get the current time.
4. We initialize a variable `currentValue` to 0, which represents the starting value of Bitcoin.
5. We create an empty string called "bitcoinFile" and use `File("bitcoin.txt")`. This creates a file in the same directory as our program that will store the current value of Bitcoin we read from every five seconds.
6. We read the contents of the "bitcoin.txt" file into a String variable called `contents`.
7. We calculate the new value of Bitcoin based on the exchange rate and add it to the `currentValue` variable.
8. We call a function `setBitcionValue(value)`, which updates the current value of Bitcoin with the given value.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
