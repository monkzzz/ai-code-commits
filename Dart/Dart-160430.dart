 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's some sample code in Dart that checks the value of Bitcoin every five seconds and stores it in a text file, along with a comment explaining each line of code:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

// Set up a timer to check for updates every 5 seconds
final Timer timer = Timer( Duration.seconds( 5 ) );
timer.timeInterval = const TimeUnit.SECONDS;

// Read the value of Bitcoin from a text file and store it in a variable
late String bitcoinValueFromFile = readFile('bitcoin-value.txt');

// Print the current value of Bitcoin to the console
print( 'The current value of Bitcoin is: $' + bitcoinValueFromFile );
```

This code reads the value of Bitcoin from a text file called `bitcoin-value.txt`, which should contain the latest value of Bitcoin at any given time. It then prints this value to the console every five seconds.
